# Bioinformatic project

Predict active regulatory regions in K562 cell line. The considered tasks are

    - AEvsIE: active enanchers vs incative enanchers;
    - APvsIP: active promoters vs incative promoters.

The neural network models used to predict such tasks are:

    - Feed-Forward Neural Network;
    - Convolutional Neural Network;
    - Multi-Modal Neural Network;
    
## Files
