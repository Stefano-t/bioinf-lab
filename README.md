# Bioinformatic Laboratory

This repo will host the exercises done during the online session and
the future project.  All the material is available at link
https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/bioinformatics_practice.

# Project

## Aim

Predict active regulatory regions in specific cell lines.

## Tasks

- **AEvsIE** = active enanchers vs incative enanchers
- **APvsIP** = active promoters vs incative promoters

## Dataset

**HG38**: https:://github.com/AnacletoLAB/epigenomic_dataset

## NN models

- FFNN
- CNN
- MMNN

Each task must be tackled by a NN, and the models may be combined or
created from scratch.
